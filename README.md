# Conglomerate Benchmark
The Conglomerate is an algorithmically generated dataset meant to mimic the data warehouse of a large corporation operating across many domains. Its scale is meant to overwhelm a text-to-SQL system, posing a difficult search problem because there are so many, possibly ambiguous, tables and columns.

The first version of the benchmark we are publishing is V1 Lite. The question and data set can be found in `/v1/lite/`
